- **Drag & Drop UI**: Simple, clean interface for uploading files and managing API keys
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Powered by Bun runtime, vanilla HTML/JS/CSS frontend

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime installed on your system
- Google Gemini API keys (free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))
- Notion API key (from [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd invoice-processor

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment file and configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Notion API key (see detailed setup below)
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
bun run dev

# Production mode
bun run start
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:3000` by default (configurable via `PORT` in `.env`).

## 🔑 Detailed API Key Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create a Notion Integration (Get API Key)

This is the **most common source of errors**. Follow each step carefully:

1. **Open Notion** in your browser and log in
2. Go to **[notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)**
3. Click the **"+ New integration"** button (top right)
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Integration name**: `Invoice Processor` (or whatever you want)
   - **Associated workspace**: Select your workspace from the dropdown
   - **Icon**: Optional — upload an icon or skip
5. Click **"Submit"** to create the integration
6. You'll be taken to the integration's settings page
7. Click on the **"Internal Integration"** tab (or "Configuration" tab)
8. Under **"Internal Integration Secret"**, click **"Show"** or **"Refresh"**
9. **Copy the token** — it will look like:
   ```
   ntn_1234567890abcdef... (long string)
   ```
   > ⚠️ **Important**: If you had a token starting with `secret_`, that's the old format. Notion now issues tokens starting with `ntn_`. Both work.
10. **Open your `.env` file** in the project root and paste it:
    ```env
    NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_your-token-here
    ```

> 🔄 **If your token stops working**: Go back to the integration settings page and click **"Refresh"** under Internal Integration Secret to generate a new token. **Old tokens are invalidated immediately when you refresh.** Update your `.env` file with the new token.

### Step 2: Share a Notion Page with Your Integration

**Your integration cannot access your workspace by default.** You must manually share at least one page with it:

1. **Open Notion** and navigate to any page in your workspace (this will be the parent page where the invoice database is created)
2. **Create a new page** if you don't have one:
   - Click **"+ New Page"** in the sidebar
   - Name it something like `"Invoice Processor"` or `"Work"`
   - The page can be blank — it just needs to exist
3. On that page, click the **"•••" (three dots)** menu in the **top-right corner** of the page
4. Scroll down and click **"Add connections"** (or "Connect to" in some versions)
5. In the search box, **type the name of your integration** (e.g., "Invoice Processor")
6. **Click your integration** in the dropdown list to select it
7. You should see a confirmation that the connection was added

> ✅ **Verify**: The integration name should now appear in the page's connections list. If you see it, the page is shared correctly.

### Step 3: Verify Your Setup

1. **Save your `.env` file** with the correct `NOTION_API_KEY`
2. **Restart the server** if it's running:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   bun run dev
   ```
3. The server will automatically test the Notion connection on startup and report any issues

### Step 4: Google Gemini API Keys

1. Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"** in the left sidebar
4. Copy the generated key (starts with `AIza...`)
5. Add it to the Invoice Processor UI in the **⚙️ Gemini API Keys** section (at the bottom of the page)

> **Tip**: Create multiple API keys for automatic rotation and fallback. The system randomly selects a key per request and retries with other keys if one fails.

## 📋 Usage

1. **Open** `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. **Add Gemini API Keys** in the ⚙️ section at the bottom
3. **Upload invoices** by dragging & dropping files or clicking the upload zone
4. **Click "Process Invoices"** to start OCR processing
5. **View results** — extracted data appears in formatted cards
6. **Check Notion** — a new "Invoice Processor" database is auto-created with all invoice data

### Supported File Formats

| Format | Extensions | Max Size |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Images | PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP | 50 MB |
| Documents | PDF | 50 MB |

> **Note**: PDFs are sent directly to Gemini as base64-encoded files. Gemini 3 Flash processes them natively with its vision pipeline.

```

### Request Flow

1. User uploads invoice files (images or PDFs) via drag & drop
2. Bun server receives files, validates types/sizes, encodes to base64
3. Random Gemini API key selected from pool
4. File sent to `gemini-3-flash-preview` with structured JSON schema
5. Gemini returns extracted invoice data as JSON
6. Invoice data saved to Notion database (auto-created if needed)
7. Results displayed in browser with formatted cards

## 🔧 Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `NOTION_API_KEY` | Notion integration token (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`) | _(required)_ |
| `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` | Existing database ID (leave empty to auto-create) | _(auto)_ |
| `PORT` | Server port number | `3000` |

---

## 🔄 API Key Rotation

The system supports multiple Gemini API keys for:

- **Load Balancing**: Random key selection distributes requests across keys
- **Failover**: If one key fails (rate limit, error), automatically retries with next key
- **Usage Tracking**: View request count and last used timestamp per key

### Managing Keys via UI

1. Scroll to **⚙️ Gemini API Keys** section
2. Paste a key and click **"Add Key"**
3. View all keys in the table with usage statistics
4. Delete keys with the **Delete** button

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API token is invalid" (Notion 401 Unauthorized)

This is the **most common error**. Here's exactly how to fix it:

1. **Check your token in `.env`**:
   ```env
   NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_your-token-here
   ```
   - Make sure there are **no trailing spaces** or invisible characters
   - The token should start with `ntn_` (new format) or `secret_` (old format)

2. **Verify the token is still valid**:
   - Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
   - Click on your integration
   - Go to **"Internal Integration"** tab
   - If you see a **"Refresh"** button, your token is still valid (don't click refresh unless you need to!)
   - If the token looks different from what's in your `.env`, copy the new one

3. **⚠️ DO NOT click "Refresh"** unless your token is compromised — this **immediately invalidates** your current token

4. **Restart the server** after updating `.env`:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C), then:
   bun run dev
   ```

5. **Test the token manually** (optional):
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ntn_your-token-here" \
        -H "Notion-Version: 2026-03-11" \
        https://api.notion.com/v1/users/me
   ```
   If you get a JSON response with your bot info, the token is valid.

### "No pages found in Notion workspace"

This means **no pages are shared** with your integration:

1. Open Notion and go to any page (or create a new one)
2. Click **"•••"** → **"Add connections"** → select your integration
3. Restart the server

### "No Gemini API keys configured"

- Add at least one API key in the ⚙️ section of the UI
- Keys are stored in memory and lost on server restart — re-add after restart

### Gemini API rate limit errors

- Add more API keys to distribute the load
- The system automatically retries with different keys on failure

### TypeScript compilation errors

```bash
# Verify TypeScript compiles
bun run type-check

# Reinstall dependencies
bun install
```
